# Outline x Discord ![Docker Build](https://github.com/lolPants/outline-discord/workflows/Docker%20Build/badge.svg)
> Custom build of [Outline](https://github.com/outline/outline) that adds Discord Authentication

## ðŸš€ Setup
Setup is mostly the same as the [official instructions](https://github.com/outline/outline#docker), so read them first. However, instead of using official Outline docker images, use the [custom image](https://github.com/lolPants/outline-discord/pkgs/container/outline-discord).

See also [this article](https://blog.gurucomputing.com.au/deploying-outline-with-docker-and-caddy/) for more specialised deployment details.
